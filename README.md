     # Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a spellbook logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Following proper MVC design pattern, I used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. The application was deployed on Heroku and can be found in https://hidden-sea-88883.herokuapp.com/.

### Application Details

* Standard Book of Spells! is a *Harry Potter* inspired app that lets users input the names of spells they'd like to cast.

* Whenever a user submits a spell's name, the app will display the spell on the left side of the page -- waiting to be cast.

* Each spell in the waiting area also has a `Cast it!` button. When the user clicks it, the spell will move to the bottom of the page.

* The app stores every spell in a database, whether cast or not. And each spell can be easily renamed just by clicking on it.
